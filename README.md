# Personal Finance OS

A production-grade personal finance system designed to track spending,
summarize financial behavior, and explain decisions in plain English.

This project focuses on **engineering quality, clarity, and scalability**
rather than feature breadth.

## Why This Project Exists

Most personal finance tools are either:
- Too simplistic (spreadsheets)
- Too complex (full banking platforms)

Personal Finance OS aims to sit in the middle:
- Simple enough to use manually
- Robust enough to scale into a real product
